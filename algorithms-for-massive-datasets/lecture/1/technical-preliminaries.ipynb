Clicking on that section of the tab will show you some more details, and in particular you'll notice that VMs are named Â«amd-cluster-mÂ», Â«amd-cluster-w0Â», and Â«amd-cluster-w1Â» in order to differentiate between master and workers. You can ssh into these instances, again clicking on the Â«SSHÂ» button or using a terminal as follows. "

If you check the detailed charges, however, you will notice that the resources we used have actually been accounted for, although they were used for so small a time that we did not incur in any cost charge.

When a more reliable computing environment is needed and the Colab frontend can be hosted on a machine provided by us, for instance a VM spinned up using GCP, as previously explained.
