# Exercise 3: Approximated Trigonometric Functions.
# Let's write a library to implement sin(x, n) by using the Taylor's series 
# (where n is the level of approximation, i.e., 1 only one item, 2 two items, 3 three items and so on).

# Let's compare your function with the one implemented in the math module at the growing of the approximation level.

# Hint. Use a generator for the factorial and a comprehension for the series.
